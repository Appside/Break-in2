Fossil evidence demonstrates similarities between birds and other feathered dinosaurs, including hollow bones, nest building and similar brooding behaviours. Although the dinosaurian lineage of birds is largely undisputed, the evolution of powered flight in birds is still debated. Two theories of flight in birds are the “ground-up” theory, and the “trees-down” theory. Ground-up theorists suggest birds evolved powered flight from ground dwelling dinosaurs, and trees-down theorists suggest birds evolved from tree dwelling, gliding dinosaurs.

"passage":"A feral cat is a domestic cat that was raised in the wild, without having experienced significant human contact. Feral cats differ from stray cats, in that strays were previously pets which became nomadic. Unlike strays, feral cats initially show hostility towards humans, particularly upon first contact. Feral cats may become invasive to ecosystems, particularly on insular islands, resulting in a decline in biodiversity. Non-indigenous feral cats often have few natural predators, and prey on local species unaccustomed to defending against cats. Ground nesting birds, small native mammals and even amphibian species are often impacted by invasive populations of feral cats, and have led to extinctions of these species in some cases.",
"question":"True or False: Both stray and feral cats exhibit hostility when first encountering humans.",
"answers":["True","False","Cannot Say"],

A common criticism of scientific management was the dehumanising effects these rigid structures had on workers, which were treated akin to parts of a machine.

 "passage": "Presently, the term surreal is used to denote a curious imaginative effect. The word’s origin can be traced back to the revolutionary surrealism movement which grew out of Dadaism in the mid-1920s. Surrealism spread quite rapidly across European arts and literature, particularly in France, between the two world wars. The movement’s founder – French poet Andre Breton – was influenced heavily by Freud’s theories, as he countered against reason and logic in order to free the imagination from the unconscious mind. Surrealist works, both visual and oral, juxtaposed seemingly unconnected everyday objects and placed these in dreamlike settings. Thus, the popularity of surrealist paintings, including Salvador Dali’s, lies in the eccentric positioning of powerful images such as leaping tigers, melting watches and metronomes. Surrealist art is widely recognised today, unlike the less easily understandable works of the French surrealist writers who, ignoring the literal meanings of words, focused instead on word associations and implications. That said, the literary surrealist tradition still survives in modern-day proponents of experimental writing.",

 "passage": "Huge debate surrounded the construction between 1994 and 2006 of what was then the world’s largest hydroelectric dam, the Three Gorges Dam. Crossing China’s 1.4-mile wide Yangtze River in the Hubei province with 26 state-of-the-art turbines, the Chinese state has heralded the dam as a symbol of China’s modernisation and engineering prowess. It aids China’s economic development by providing over 10% of its electricity. However, over 1.3 million people were intentionally displaced as part of the Gorges flooding project that created the dam’s 660km-long reservoir. Hundreds of archaeological sites, both above and below ground level, were lost under the reservoir’s water. Questions remain as to whether the dam – as a source of renewable energy – improves the surrounding environment, or diminishes it by causing, for example, landslides and loss of fish species in the Yangtze. Supporters argue that the dam has made the Yangtze easier for large ships to navigate and has reduced the risk of flooding downstream by deepening the river. As the only other viable Chinese energy source is non-renewable coal power, the hydroelectric power produced by the dam may be the lesser of two evils.",

Title IV, a 1972 law forbidding sex discrimination in education, was revised in 2006 permitting the formation of single-sex state schools as long as a co-educational alternative exists. While critics see single-sex schools as prejudiced and as poor preparation for adult life, supporters assert that children, and especially girls, profit from a single-sex education. Some American research demonstrates that girls attending single-sex schools have higher self-esteem, contribute more in class, and score higher on aptitude tests than other girls in co educational schools. A 2005 study stated that both girls and boys at single-sex schools spent more time on homework and had fewer disciplinary issues. Single-sex schools disrupt stereotypical course-taking trends and results. Advocates of single-sex schools claim that educators can provide better teaching by altering their tuition to reflect recent research about gender-based brain development.

 "passage": " The democratic peace theory asserts that liberal democracies seldom go to war against each other. The first to support this notion was the German philosopher Immanuel Kant, who postulated that constitutional republics stimulate peace, since the majority of population will not vote to go to war except if in self-defence. In more recent times, the democratic peace theory was taken further by Dean Babst in 1964. Babst performed the first statistical study into the theory, thus scientifically demonstrating that democracies hardly fight each other. Despite an irrefutable statistical connection between democracy and peace, the democratic peace theory is highly disputed amongst diplomatic scientists. The definitions of “democracy” and “war” are a quarrelsome issue. Some challengers of the democratic peace theory point to outliers, for example the Spanish-American War. Nonetheless, the chief criticism of the theory is that it is founded on unsound logic – that harmony between democracies is not a result of the democratic nature of those states. Additionally, opponents claim that democracies regularly attack non-democracies, dismissing the notion that democracies are fundamentally pacifistic. There are numerous derivatives of the democratic peace theory, such as the economic peace theory, which states that improving the economic exchange between states may lead to a lower chance of conflict.",

The first to support this notion was the German philosopher Immanuel Kant, who postulated that constitutional republics stimulate peace, since the majority of population will not vote to go to war except if in self-defence. In more recent times, the democratic peace theory was taken further by Dean Babst in 1964. Babst performed the first statistical study into the theory, thus scientifically demonstrating that democracies hardly fight each other. Despite an irrefutable statistical connection between democracy and peace, the democratic peace theory is highly disputed amongst diplomatic scientists. The definitions of “democracy” and “war” are a quarrelsome issue. Some challengers of the democratic peace theory point to outliers, for example the Spanish-American War. Nonetheless, the chief criticism of the theory is that it is founded on unsound logic – that harmony between democracies is not a result of the democratic nature of those states. Additionally, opponents claim that democracies regularly attack non-democracies, dismissing the notion that democracies are fundamentally pacifistic. There are numerous derivatives of the democratic peace theory, such as the economic peace theory, which states that improving the economic exchange between states may lead to a lower chance of conflict.",

 "passage": " The discussion about the British Museum’s Parthenon sculptures, also known as the Elgin Marbles, has been going on for almost two centuries. The marble statues were exhumed in 1801 – with official permission – from the remnants of the Parthenon by Lord Elgin, the British Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. He sold these ageless Greek treasures to the British Museum in 1816, where they have been kept ever since. Nowadays, 5 million visitors from all over the world come to view the sculptures, free of charge, at the British Museum. Since the Greek government achieved independence in 1830, they have argued that the statues be returned to Athens. Previously, the Hellenic position was based on ownership, maintaining that Lord Elgin bribed authorities to obtain the sculptures illegitimately. Opposition argued that Lord Elgin prevented these classical treasures from being neglected. Greece no longer disagrees with the British Museum’s ownership, but wants the sculptures to be lent to the New Acropolis Museum in Athens, where they could be placed with the remaining sculptures that survived and be exhibited in their correct geographical and cultural context. Even with public sympathy for the homecoming of the Elgin marbles, the British Museum considers the Parthenon marbles part of collective world heritage and hence should be widely reachable.

 "passage": " A lot of people know that high cholesterol increases the chance of heart disease, however they will be astonished to hear that cholesterol performs vital functions in the human body. A fat created in the liver and present in animal cell membranes, cholesterol is needed to repair tissues and break down other fats, as well as in the production of hormones, bile salts, and Vitamin D. Nevertheless, issues arise when there is a surplus of cholesterol as it builds up in blood vessels, blocking blood flow. A human’s blood cholesterol count is formed of two distinctive kinds of cholesterol: low-density lipoprotein (LDL), often known as the “bad” cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), called “good” cholesterol. While HDL transports cholesterol to the liver and away from the arteries, LDL transfers cholesterol from the liver to the arteries where it gathers. Even though particular foodstuffs derived from animals, for example meat, shellfish, cheese and eggs, have a lot of dietary cholesterol, it is in fact the intake of the saturated fats in things such as red meat, full-fat dairy products, cakes and biscuits that elevate “bad” cholesterol levels.

Moreover, in overpopulated parts, food shortages are motivating kangaroos to destroy wheat crops. Activists usually oppose the cull on grounds that it is callous. Rather, they prefer the relocation of the animals to apt new habitats, or sterilising the kangaroos in highly populated areas. Sterilisation, though, will take some time to have an effect on the issues of inadequate resources and land degradation through grazing. Not only will moving large numbers of kangaroos be an expensive process, critics feel it would possibly traumatize the transferred animals and eventually threaten the new habitat.",
