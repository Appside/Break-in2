Fossil evidence demonstrates similarities between birds and other feathered dinosaurs, including hollow bones, nest building and similar brooding behaviours. Although the dinosaurian lineage of birds is largely undisputed, the evolution of powered flight in birds is still debated. Two theories of flight in birds are the “ground-up” theory, and the “trees-down” theory. Ground-up theorists suggest birds evolved powered flight from ground dwelling dinosaurs, and trees-down theorists suggest birds evolved from tree dwelling, gliding dinosaurs. Further research is required to conclusively verify the process in which birds evolved powered flight.",

"passage":"A feral cat is a domestic cat that was raised in the wild, without having experienced significant human contact. Feral cats differ from stray cats, in that strays were previously pets which became nomadic. Unlike strays, feral cats initially show hostility towards humans, particularly upon first contact. Feral cats may become invasive to ecosystems, particularly on insular islands, resulting in a decline in biodiversity. Non-indigenous feral cats often have few natural predators, and prey on local species unaccustomed to defending against cats. Ground nesting birds, small native mammals and even amphibian species are often impacted by invasive populations of feral cats, and have led to extinctions of these species in some cases.",
"question":"True or False: Both stray and feral cats exhibit hostility when first encountering humans.",
"answers":["True","False","Cannot Say"],
"correctAnswer":1,
"explanation":"The passage states that “Unlike strays, feral cats initially show hostility towards humans”. Since this distinguishes stray cats from feral cats, the correct answer is “False”."

"passage":"The paradox of thrift, as popularised by John Keynes, highlights the fact that excessive saving during times of economic recession negatively impacts the economy. When spending is reduced due to excessive saving, aggregate demand falls, resulting in lowered economic growth. This excessive saving results in reduced economic growth, which in turn encourages further excessive saving, causing a vicious cycle. Reduced economic growth results in reductions in salary, job security and interest on savings, negatively impacting both savers and the economy.

Frederick Taylor championed scientific management during the late 19th and early 20th century’s within manufacturing.

A common criticism of scientific management was the dehumanising effects these rigid structures had on workers, which were treated akin to parts of a machine.
