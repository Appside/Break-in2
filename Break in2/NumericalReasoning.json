"answers":["10","1,000","5,000","10,000"],
"correctAnswer":1,
"explaination":"The trick to this question is to recognise that the graph gives sales figures cumulatively. Step 1 - We see from the graph that the cumulative Bernd sales at the end of April are 9,000. We see that the cumulative Bernd sales at the end of May are 10,000. Step 2 - Therefore during May (10,000 – 9,000 =) 1,000 Bernd cars must have been sold. Thus the correct answer is (B) 1,000."

"explaination":"Don’t waste time working out the sales for each month. Since the data is cumulative, we can say combined sales for May, June and July = (cumulative sales for end of July) – (cumulative sales end of April). Step 1 - (Cumulative sales July) – (Cumulative sales April) = (21,000) – (15,000) = 6,000. Thus the correct answer is (D) 6,000."

"correctAnswer":0,
"explaination":"Step 1 - First, find out the number of Bernd cars sold in June. From the cumulative graph we see this is 1,000. Step 2 - Now, compare this with how many Bernd cars were actually sold in July. We see from the graph there were no sales 1,000 – 0 = 1,000. Thus the correct answer is (A) 1,000."

Note that already we have eliminated 3 of the possible 5 answers. Step 2 - Jessica: 81 x 85% = 68.85 = 69 & 81 x 115% = 93.15 = 93, Kim: 70 x 85% = 59.5 = 60 & 70 x 115% = 80.5 = 81.
