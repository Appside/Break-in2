  "answers":["2,400","£2,600","2,800","3,000","3,200"],
  "correctAnswer":1,
  "explaination":"Step 1 – Let x = Jessica’s average mileage per client visit: July visits = 70 = 3,500 / x, x = 3,500 / 70 = 50 miles per visit. Step 2 – Calculate Simon’s average mileage per client visit: 50 – 10 = 40 miles per visit. Step 3 – Calculate the total number of miles Simon travelled in July: 40 x 65 = 2,600 miles. Thus the correct answer is (B) 2,600 miles."
